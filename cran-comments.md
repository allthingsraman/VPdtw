* New submission

- While this is marked as a new submission, it was in fact [published on CRAN previously](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/VPdtw/index.html).
VPdtw was removed from CRAN on 2017-03-13 -- apparently, because the
"native routines" were not properly registered. This issue has been remedied with
this new version. I  am taking over from David Clifford as maintainer with his 
permission.
